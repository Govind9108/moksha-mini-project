How to talk about daily routines.

2
0:00:05----> 0:00:11
My daily routine is nothing special.

3
0:00:11----> 0:00:15
I usually wake up early around 7 a.m.

4
0:00:15----> 0:00:23
Breakfast is not important to me, so I usually only drink a cup of coffee.

5
0:00:23----> 0:00:27
Sometimes, though, I will have an apple.

6
0:00:27----> 0:00:30
Breakfast is followed by a shower.

7
0:00:30----> 0:00:35
After I get dressed, I go to work.

8
0:00:35----> 0:00:38
Work is always the same during the morning.

9
0:00:38----> 0:00:45
I respond to emails and set up meetings.

10
0:00:45----> 0:00:49
Around lunchtime, I start to feel really hungry.

11
0:00:49----> 0:00:56
Often, my friends and I meet at a cafe to have lunch together.

12
0:00:57----> 0:01:02
When dinner time comes around, however, I cook dinner at home.

13
0:01:02----> 0:01:09
After dinner, I take my dog for a walk to the park.

14
0:01:09----> 0:01:13
We can usually see the sunset, which is quite beautiful.

15
0:01:13----> 0:01:20
I watch TV series or movies at night.

16
0:01:20----> 0:01:23
There is nothing like a good movie before bed.

17
0:01:23----> 0:01:29
I sleep at 10 p.m. and then start the whole routine over again the next day.
